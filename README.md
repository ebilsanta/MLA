# IS460: Machine Learning and Applications Project G1T4

This repository contains scripts we used for data processing. The raw datasets have to be downloaded from their original sources as they are too large to host here.

* [Choral Singing Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/1286570)
* [Esmuc Choir Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/5848990)

Instructions to set up and run the scripts are found in the respective folders eg. ```datasets/[dataset]```.
